# Workload

The Workload module is composed by Workload API functions and is intended to be used by the final user. It was mostly based on the [go-spiffe](https://github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe) Workload API implementation. All the supported functions are implemented. Refer to the test folder for some examples.
