# Bundle

The Bundle module is composed by utility functions for bundles, such as creation, deletion and validation. Most used internally by other modules. It contains three sub modules:

* **jwtbundle** Contains utility functions for bundles using the JWT specification.
* **x509bundle** Contains utility functions for bundles using the X509 specification.
* **spiffebundle** Not implemented yet. It will contain convenience functions for both modules.
